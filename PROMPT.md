- Hotspots need a countdown timer for each controlled hotspots for next income generation. Essentially, each hotspot will have an accumulated income being generated which accumulates every hour. The countdown timer shows the time until next income generation which gets added to the accumulated income generated until collected. When collected, it transfers to the player and accumulated income generated becomes 0. If taken over while hostpot has an accumlated income, the accumulated income can be collected by the new controlling player. the time until next income generation depends on when the hotspot was taken over. so, each hostpot will have generate income at different intervals. hotspots should also have a collect button to allow for individual hotspot income collection as well.
- Income collection function should fall under territory service instead of player service.
- I am unsure how can we sync the frontend income generation timer with the backend? i need a simple yet cost effective solution that wouldnt put much burden on the game server? WebSocket or SSE? what do you think?
