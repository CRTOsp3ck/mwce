URGENT
- Create an API endpoint to allow the front-end to load the related game configs & mechanics to use for front end logic & validation stuff
- Figure out why ocasionally the takeover fails and you get 'incorrect request format' or something along those lines

NON URGENT
- Create an event bus for the front-end so as an when the events occur, states can subscribe to the changes.
- With every player joined, we can make a new system will generate a new hotspot.
- Create a revenue scheduler
- Backend is not updating
- Backstory for each hotspots. So when click on a hotspot card, there should be like an image and description portraying the hotspot. Ideally each region, district and cities should have their own backstory and images.
